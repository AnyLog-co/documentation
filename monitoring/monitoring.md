# Monitoring 

When it comes to the idea of monitoring through AnyLog / EdgeLake, this could mean an array of things: 
* [Aggregation](aggregations.md) - in which the user is monitoring the actual data as it flows in 
* [System](monitoring_machine.md) in which the user is monitoring the state of the machine
* [Logs](monitoring_logs.md) in which the user is monitoring the _Syslog_ of the machine 
* [Container](monitoring_container.md) in which the user is monitoring the container itself. In this case there are cases, such as using 
[Kubernetes](monitoring_container.md#kubernetes-with-kubearmor), where data is indirectly coming into AnyLog / EdgeLake
