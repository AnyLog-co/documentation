# How too use Postman as the query interface
Postman is an API platform for building and using APIs. 
For AnyLog purposes, you can run queries through Postman with either SSL enabled or not. 
You can download Postman here: https://www.postman.com/downloads/.
We layout an example below for "GET" requests. 

### Without SSL
To run AnyLog queries using Postman, follow the following steps:
1. Open Postman
2. Create a collection
3. Add a request
4. Enter the request URL and port number (the URL can also be an IP address)
5. Add 2 header keys: "User-Agent" and "command" with values "AnyLog/1.23" and "[query command]", respectively
