# Bucket Commands

The ***bucket*** command provides a means to push (upload) and pull (download) files from a bucket object storage.
See [examples](#examples) below.

## üåê Supported Backends
- **Akave Cloud** (currently supported for file object management).  
- **AWS S3** (the API is AWS-compatible, but direct support is not yet fully tested. Official AWS support will be extended soon).

# Examples
```bash
#Step 1 - declare provider 
bucket provider connect where group = my_group and provider = akave and id = 123 and access_key = [access_key] and secret_key = [secret_key] and region = akave-network and endpoint_url = [endpoint_url]

# Step 2 - view providers 
get bucket groups

# Step 3 - create bucket (See bucket naming restrictions Bucket Naming Rules )
bucket create where group = my_group and name = my-bucket

#Step 4 - view all buckets by group
get bucket names where group = my_group

#Step 5 - view all files in bucket or by prefix
get bucket files where group = my_group and name = my-bucket and prefix = dir1 and format = json
get bucket files where group = my_group and name = my-bucket and format = json

#Step 6 - upload file
bucket file upload where group = my_group and name = my-bucket and source_dir = /Users/roy and file_name = test.txt and key = dir1/test2.txt

#Step 7 - download file
bucket file download where group = my_group and name = my-bucket and key = test.txt and dest_dir = /Users/roy/test2 and file_name = test.txt

#Step 8 - delete file by key or set of files by prefix (note if prefix and key set, both will be deleted)
bucket file delete where group = my_group and name = my-bucket and key = test.txt
bucket file delete where group = my_group and name = my-bucket and prefix = dir1
bucket file delete where group = my_group and name = my-bucket and key = test2.txt and prefix = dir1

#Step 8 - get file metadata
get bucket file info where group = my_group and name = my-bucket and key = test2.txt

#Step 9 - drop/delete bucket (note that you cannot delete a non-empty bucket. to delete non-empty bucket, set deleteAllFiles = true)
bucket drop where group = my_group and name = my-bucket and deleteAllFiles = false
bucket drop where group = my_group and name = my-bucket and deleteAllFiles = true
