# Deploying a Node
This document provides general directions for deploying an AnyLog node, via _Docker_. There are 5 main types of 
AnyLog Nodes: 
* **REST** - An AnyLog node that has all the variables declared, as well as connecting to _TCP_, _REST_ and
_Broker_ (if declared). 
* **Master** – A node that manages the shared metadata (if a blockchain platform is used, this node is redundant).
* **Operator** – A node that hosts the data. For this deployment we will have 2 Operator nodes.
* **Query** – A node that coordinates the query process. 
* **Publisher** - A node that supports distribution of data from device(s) to operator nodes. This node is not part of the
deployment diagram. However, is often used in large scale projects. 


### Basic Deployment
Our basic deployment is a node of type REST. The deployment does not require any user-defined configurations, 
automatically connects to ports 2148 for _TCP_ and 2149 for _REST_. Users can easily extend the deployment to also 
connect to a message broker by setting an environment variable - `-e ANYLOG_BROKER_PORT=2150`. 

```shell
docker run --network host -it --detach-keys=ctrl-d \
  --name anylog-node \
  [-e ANYLOG_BROKER_PORT=2150]
  [--volume anylog-dir:/app/AnyLog-Network/anylog \]
  [--volume blockchain-dir:/app/AnyLog-Network/blockchain \]
  [--volume data-dir:/app/AnyLog-Network/data \]
  -rm anylogco/anylog-network:predevelop
```

### Configuration Based Deployment
For a simplified process, feel free to utilize our deployment script. 
```shell
bash $HOME/deployments/deployment_scripts/deploy_node.sh
```
1. Fill-out the Anylog configurations file for a node
   * If you're using AnyLog overlay network make sure INTERNAL_IP address of all the nodes are in the same subnet
   * Make sure the database credentials are the same as what's configured in your PostgresSQL database
   * If you're changing the `ANYLOG_SERVER_PORT` make sure to also change the port associated with the `LEDGER_CONN`
   * A location that's not preset will be autogenerated when node is deployed  

Sample configurations for specific node types can be found in [deployments](https://github/AnyLog-co/deployments/docker-compose) Invalid link

2. By default, AnyLog is deployed using our `predevelop` version. Version changes can be done in the [.env](https://github.com/AnyLog-co/deployments/blob/master/docker-compose/anylog-rest/.env)
```dotenv
BUILD=predevelop
ENV_FILE=anylog_configs.env
CONTAINER_NAME=anylog-node
NETWORK=host
```

3. Deploy Node
```shell
cd $HOME/deployments/docker-compose/anylog-rest/
docker-compose up -d
```
