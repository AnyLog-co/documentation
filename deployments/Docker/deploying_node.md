# Deploying a Node
This document provides general directions for deploying an AnyLog node, via _Docker_. There are 5 main types of 
AnyLog Nodes: 
* **REST** - An AnyLog node that has all the variables declared, as well as connecting to _TCP_, _REST_ and
_Broker_ (if declared). 
* **Master** – A node that manages the shared metadata (if a blockchain platform is used, this node is redundant).
* **Operator** – A node that hosts the data. For this deployment we will have 2 Operator nodes.
* **Query** – A node that coordinates the query process. 
* **Publisher** - A node that supports distribution of data from device(s) to operator nodes. This node is not part of the
deployment diagram. However, is often used in large scale projects. 


### Basic Deployment
Our basic deployment is a node of type REST. The deployment does not require any user-defined configurations,  
automatically connects to ports 2148 for _TCP_ and 2149 for _REST_. However, users can easily extend the deployment to 
also connect to a message broker by setting an environment variable - `-e ANYLOG_BROKER_PORT=2150`.

```shell
docker run --network host -it --detach-keys=ctrl-d \
  --name anylog-node \
  [-e ANYLOG_SERVER_PORT=32148 \] 
  [-e ANYLOG_REST_PORT=32149 \] 
  [-e ANYLOG_BROKER_PORT=2150 \] 
  [--volume anylog-dir:/app/AnyLog-Network/anylog \]
  [--volume blockchain-dir:/app/AnyLog-Network/blockchain \]
  [--volume data-dir:/app/AnyLog-Network/data \]
  -rm anylogco/anylog-network:predevelop
```

### Configuration Based Deployment
For a simplified process, feel free to utilize our deployment script. The script updates the AnyLog configuration 
file for either Docker or Kubernetes, along with the `.env` file for Docker deployment. When using it, keep in mind:
   * PostgreSQL and MongoDB physical database are [deployed](database_configuration.md)  
   * In the configuration options, A location that's not preset will be autogenerated when node is deployed based on
   [ipinfo.io]( https://ipinfo.io/json)
   * A _Query_ node deployed through this script will also deploy the Remote-CLI
```shell
bash $HOME/deployments/deployment_scripts/deploy_node.sh
```

A step-by-step explanation of happens on the AnyLog instance when a node is deployed can be found in files endng with  
"deployment_process.md".
* [Master Node](master_node_deployment_process.md)
* [Operator Node](operator_node_deployment_process.md)
* [Publisher Node](publisher_node_deployment_process.md)
* [Query Node](query_node_deployment_process.md)

```dotenv
# --- General ---
# Information regarding which AnyLog node configurations to enable. By default, even if everything is disabled, AnyLog starts TCP and REST connection protocols [Default: rest]
NODE_TYPE=rest
# Name of the AnyLog instance [Default: anylog-node]
NODE_NAME=anylog-node
# Owner of the AnyLog instance [Default: New Company]
COMPANY_NAME=New Company
# Coordinates of the machine - used by Grafana to map the network [Default: 0.0, 0.0]
#LOCATION=<GENERAL_LOCATION>
# Country where machine is located [Default: Unknown]
#COUNTRY=<GENERAL_COUNTRY>
# State where machine is located [Default: Unknown]
#STATE=<GENERAL_STATE>
# City where machine is located [Default: Unknown]
#CITY=<GENERAL_CITY>

# --- Authentication ---
# When using AnyLog authentication, nodes should have authentcation enabled once declared as a member on the blockchain [Default: false]
ENABLE_AUTH=false
# Whether or not to enable authentication when accessing node via REST [Default: false]
ENABLE_REST_AUTH=false
# Provide a password to protect sensitive information that is kept on the node
#NODE_PASSWORD=<AUTHENTICATION_NODE_PASSWORD>
# user that can connect to this node [Default: user1]
USER_NAME=user1
# Password associated with the user
#USER_PASSWORD=<AUTHENTICATION_USER_PASSWORD>
# The type of user [Default: admin]
USER_TYPE=admin
# Password used by the ROOT member in authentication
#ROOT_PASSWORD=<AUTHENTICATION_ROOT_PASSWORD>

# --- Networking ---
## By default, a node will connect to the (TCP, REST and Message Broker - if declared) based on its associated policy.
#
# If a user disables policy-based option (`POLICY_BASED_NETWORKING=false`) then network connectivity is based on information
# in the configuration file.
#
# For policy-based configuration networking will be set as follows:
#   1. A user is able to decide whether the TCP connectivity is set to bind or not. If bind is enabled - then AnyLog
#       will use either the local or overlay IP address.
#        * If an overlay is declared, then the overlay IP address will replace the local IP address
#        * If binding is enabled, then AnyLog will only utilize the local or overlay IP address. Whereas if
#          binding is disabled, the blockchain will use both the external and local (or overlay) IP addresses of the
#          physical machine.
#
#    2. For REST and Message Broker, the (default) binding value is False. This is because data and/or GET requests
#       coming-in may come from machines/devices outside the network.#
#
#    3. Regarding the relation between blockchain policy and AnyLog networking - AnyLog only cares about policy keys `ip`,
#       `local_ip` and port values. All other networking information, such as `proxy_ip` and `external_ip` (if binding is
#       True), are more of an FYI regarding the network configurations of the actual machine.#

2. By default, AnyLog is deployed using our `predevelop` version. Version changes can be done in the [.env](https://github.com/AnyLog-co/deployments/blob/master/docker-compose/anylog-rest/.env)
```dotenv
BUILD=predevelop
ENV_FILE=anylog_configs.env
CONTAINER_NAME=anylog-node
NETWORK=host
```

3. Deploy Node
```shell
cd $HOME/deployments/docker-compose/anylog-rest/
docker-compose up -d
```
