# AnyLog as a _pip_ Package 

In scenarios where lightweight deployment, tight integration with Python-based applications, or limited system resources 
are primary concerns, utilizing AnyLog via its pip package offers a flexible and efficient alternative to containerized 
or service-based setups. This approach is particularly valuable for developers building edge applications, prototyping 
data pipelines, or embedding data management directly within Python scripts. By installing AnyLog as a pip package, 
users can seamlessly run a local node, interact with data using familiar Python tools, and avoid the overhead and 
complexity of Docker orchestrationâ€”making it ideal for development environments, automation scripts, and constrained IoT 
devices.

## Deploying AnyLog as a Service

1.  Install AnyLog as a `pip` package

```shell
# Ubuntu
python3 -m pip install --upgrade http://45.33.11.32/ubuntu/anylog_network-0.0.7-cp310-cp310-linux_x86_64.whl 

# Alpine
python3 -m pip install --upgrade http://45.33.11.32/alpine/anylog_network-0.0.7-cp311-cp311-linux_x86_64.whl 

# Mac OSX  
python3 -m pip install --upgrade http://45.33.11.32/macosx/anylog_network-0.0.7-cp310-cp310-macosx_12_0_x86_64.whl
```

2. Sample Python3 Script to deploy AnyLog
```python
import sys
import anylog_node.cmd.user_cmd as user_cmd  # import AnyLog Node 

argv = sys.argv
argc = len(argv)

user_input = user_cmd.UserInput()
user_input.process_input(arguments=argc, arguments_list=argv) # Start AnyLog with CLI
```

3. Enable AnyLog  
```anylog
set license where activation_key=XXX
```
