# Scheduled Pull

## Overview

The **scheduled pull** command in AnyLog is used to periodically retrieve data from an external source â€” such as logs, 
metrics, or device readings â€” and insert it into a local database table or distribute it to other AnyLog nodes.

This mechanism is particularly useful for environments like **Windows**, where data cannot be pushed natively via syslog. 
In such cases, AnyLog uses a **scheduled pull** to fetch data directly (e.g., from the Windows Event Log).

## Command: `run scheduled pull`

This command pulls data from a specified source node on a scheduled basis.

### ðŸ“Œ Usage:
```anylog
run scheduled pull where name = [process name] and type = [data_type] and source = [IP or hostname] and frequency = [seconds] and continuous = [true/false] and dbms = [dbms name] and table = [table name] and stdout = [true/false]
```

Parameters

| Parameter  | Default | Description                                                                                                    |
|------------|---------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| name       |         | A unique process name                                                                                          |
| type       |         | The type of data to pull (e.g., `syslog`, `eventlog`, `modbus`)                                                |
| source     |         | The network identifier of the data source (`localhost` or a remote IP)                                         |
| frequency  |         | Interval in seconds between pulls (e.g., `5`)                                                                  |
| continuous | False   | If `true`, pulls continuously as long as data is available, ignoring frequency                                 |
| dbms       |         | The name of the target DBMS instance where the data will be inserted                                           |
| table      |         | The name of the target table within the DBMS                                                                   |
| stdout     | False   | If `true`, a single read result will be printed to the console (stdout) instead of being inserted into a table |

Notes:  
* Use `stdout = true` when you want to test the pull behavior or inspect the output without writing to a database.
* When `stdout = true`, only **one** data read is performed and the result is printed to the terminal or log. The pull does **not continue** even if `continuous = true`.

## Associating the pulled data with a topic

In the context of a scheduled pull, the topic = (...) clause maps the data retrieved by the pull process 
into a topic that is associated with mapping instructions.

Example:

```anylog
<run scheduled pull where 
  name = locallog 
  type = eventlog 
  and source = localhost 
  and frequency = 1 
  and topic = (
    name = eventlog 
    and dbms = my_dbms 
    and table = my_table  
    and column.timestamp.timestamp = "bring [timestamp]" 
    and column.value.int = "bring [message]"
  )>
```

Using a **topic** is optional. Details of the **topic** params are available [here](message%20broker.md#the-topic-params).

## Scheduled pull of Windows Event Log

Unlike Linux or Unix-based systems, Windows does not use the syslog protocol to manage logs.    
Instead, it uses a proprietary system called the Windows Event Log, which stores structured event records internally 
and does not natively support sending logs over the network in real-time.

Details on servicing Syslog data to AnyLog in a Unix system is available at [Using Syslog](using%20syslog.md) document.  

As a result, log data on Windows must be accessed via APIs, such as the Windows Event Log API, rather than being 
pushed out like syslog messages.

Using the **run scheduled pull** command, users can pull the Windows event log from local or remote Windows machine.

Usage:
```anylog
run scheduled pull where type = eventlog and source = localhost and frequency = 1 and dbms = sensor_data and table = event_log
```

### Filtering by Event Type

For Windows even log, users can optionally filter events by their **type** using the `event_type` parameter.

### Supported Values for `event_type`

You may specify one or more of the following event types using lowercase and underscores instead of spaces:

| Value             | Description                          |
|------------------|--------------------------------------|
| `error`           | Logs that indicate significant problems or failures |
| `warning`         | Logs that indicate potential issues or conditions to watch |
| `information`     | Logs that record normal operations and successful activity |
| `audit_success`   | Security-related logs for successful operations (e.g., login success) |
| `audit_failure`   | Security-related logs for failed operations (e.g., login failure) |
| `all`             | No filtering; pulls all available event types |

### ðŸ”§ Usage Examples

#### Pull only error logs:

```anylog
<run scheduled pull 
  where name = err_log
  and type = eventlog 
  and source = localhost 
  and frequency = 5
  and continuous = false 
  and event_type = error
  dbms = sensor_data
  and table = event_log>
```

## Command: `get scheduled pull`

The `get scheduled pull` command retrieves the status and runtime statistics of active or previously defined 
scheduled pull tasks on the node. It provides insight into the configuration and current state of each pull process.

## Command: `exit pull`

The `exit pull` command is used to **terminate scheduled pull processes** that are currently running on the node.

### ðŸ”§ Usage

#### ðŸ”¹ Terminate all running pull processes:
```anylog
exit pull all
```

####  Terminate a specific pull process by name:
```anylog
exit pull [process name]
```
Replace [process_name] with the name assigned to the pull task (as defined in run scheduled pull).
