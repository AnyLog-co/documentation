<div align="justified"><br/>AnyLog is a Real-Time Visibility and Management platform for distributed edge data, 
applications, and infrastructure

AnyLog transforms the edge into a scalable data tier optimized for IoT and time-series data, enabling organizations to 
extract real-time insights for virtually any use case. Industries such as Manufacturing, Utilities, Oil & Gas, Retail, 
Robotics, Smart Cities, Automotive, and others can all benefit from this capability.

By deploying AnyLog at the edge, each node becomes part of a peer-to-peer (P2P) network that enables unified access to 
distributed IoT data—as if it were all managed on a single machine. This architecture introduces two key tiers
* **Tier 1**: A physical tier that automates data management directly on the edge nodes. 
* **Tier 2**: A virtualized tier that enables seamless access to the distributed data from a single point.

This setup delivers a cloud-like experience for the distributed edge—making IoT data accessible in real time, from 
anywhere, at any time, and for any use case. Importantly, it eliminates the need to move data or commit to specific 
cloud providers, applications, or hardware platforms.

  IoT data accessible from anywhere, at any time, and for any use case—without the need to move data or commit to specific
  cloud providers, applications, or hardware.
