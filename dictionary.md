# The local dictionary

## Overview
The local dictionary allows hardware abstraction by associating configuration values that are specific to the hardware used
to generic keys that are shared across all deployments. The configuration process, the queries and AnyLog commands that are
issued to each node reference the shared keys which are translated to the specific values which may be different on each node.
For example: IPs and Ports, paths to files and directories used are referenced by a key name and translated on each node
to the appropriate value.
Some entries in the dictionary represent default setups and configurations, and users can add or modify entries in
the dictionary as needed.
For example, all the directories in the [default folders structure](getting%20started.md#local-directory-structure)
 can be referenced by their keys, whereas in each deployment the physical location of the folders may be different. 


Users can include in the dictionary any key value pair that is needed to support a process, for example, maintain values
generated by data ingestion or represent a node state. For example, a user can declare a key called "disk_usage" and
configure the scheduler to update the value with percentage of free space every 15 seconds and include the value
(by referencing the name) in the processes monitoring the node state.

In addition, the dictionary is used to construct, maintain and update policies before their persistent storage in the shared metadata.
